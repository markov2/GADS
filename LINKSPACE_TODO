Database issues:
  - Too many fields in the Site table are optional: f.i. host?
  - User::lastview still in use?  Never set.  In dancer session as
    'current_view' now?
  - User table site_id should be required
  - why only 3 in Permission?   Overkill
  - View::sorts negative column id translation still needed?

  - Move away from Plugin/Auth/Extensible functions.
  - $self->schema->storage->datetime_parser->format_date w.r.t to the
    new $site->local2dt

Configuration:
  - Users should get their configurable date_pattern

  - can the date_format of a column be different that the system's
    date format?

Functional changes:
  - Trees do not do an import which tries to be smart to detect renames:
    unknown names are simply added after the known childs.  Then, in the
    column configuration, one can restore the order.
  - When the same name appears again on the same level in the tree, then
    those enums are merged with the first.

TODO:
  - replace bin/app.pl with 'linkspace dance start'

Database aternations needed:
  - Add table to the database: ComponentVersions
  mysql: "last_change TIMESTAMP
        NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
     + site_id + component TEXT
  on psql via a trigger
  https://x-team.com/blog/automatic-timestamps-with-postgresql/
  Then remove 'return' in Site->changed()
